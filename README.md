A sampling of programs I wrote in Java for CS111B at City College of San Francisco.

## Project 1 - Credit Card Validator ðŸ’³
### What It Does
This program validates a credit card entered by the user. Validation checks performed are:
- Checks if card is expired.
  - Prompts user to reenter year if expiration year is before current year.
  - Prompts user to reenter month if card expires this year and expiration month is before current month. Program prints a warning if card is set to expire this month.
- Checks that card number is valid by verifying that it:
  - has a valid number of digits.
  - starts with a 4, 5, or 6.
  - passes the Checksum test using the Luhn algorithm described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm).
