A sampling of programs I wrote in Java for CS111B at City College of San Francisco.

## Project 1 - Credit Card Validator
### What It Does
This program validates a credit card entered by the user. Validation checks performed are:
- Checks if card is expired.
  - Prompts user to reenter year if expiration year is before current year.
  - Prompts user to reenter month if card expires this year and expiration month is before current month.
